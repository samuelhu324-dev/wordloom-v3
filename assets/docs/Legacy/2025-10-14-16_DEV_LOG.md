## **1 · UI / UX Refinement Requests & Toolkit Management**

### **Module 26 · 📚 Insert (UI/UX)** 
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Summary:**  The 📥 `Insert` item (the main functionality) now shows that it can be pinned to the front; otherwise, it's hard to see during entry since it's too far from the input button.

### **Module 27 · 📝 Log (Toolkit)**  
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Summary:**   To assist with log management, two new tools were added: (1) `WPS Screen Recording`; (2) `PointerFocus` for cursor highlighting and text capture.

<font color="C00000">You've already watched them from previous Module, right? But I'm very glad to show you my precious trinckets</font>

### **Module 28 · 🍫 Chocolatey (Toolkit)**  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Summary:**   Since more components will be used later, Chocolatey was installed for package management, allowing software installation via command line.

---

### **Module 29 · 📝 Log (Toolkit)**  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Summary:**   Embedding videos in markdown isn't supported, so GIFs were added alongside video links to reduce page load, while also offering an HTML version.

<font color="C00000">I believed you already saw them before, and in order for clearer view, I show you thoughful words "CLICKME! The summary does not give a reason as to why dynamic mode isn't allowed in markdown - it's against malicious tampering and interception."</font>

---

### **Module 30 · 🎞️ GIF Maker (Toolkit)**  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Summary:**    Based on the above needs, a small program `Gif Maker` was created to produce high-quality GIFs. Demonstrations start below.
- By default, it displays the filename of the last generated GIF, making it easier to manage and export identical files to the assets folder.

<font color="C00000">(And yes! All those little gifs are all created by `GIF Maker`! Very useful tool.)</font>

### **Module 31 · 🌀 Wordloom (UI/UX)**
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Summary:**    Path names were too verbose (including Chinese characters that caused errors), so a new path and a new welcome page were created — and the project now has its name: Wordloom!

<font color="C00000">As of writing, Wordloom is already a product both with `API` as independent frontend  and `streamlit` as a makeshift backend. </font>

### **Module 32 · 📝 Log (UI/UX)**  
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Summary:**   "DEV_log" and "Quick_log": For log management, both now display GIF links and corresponding MP4 video links. To improve clarity, assets were reorganized by category instead of being stored under Readlog.

<font color="C00000">Let me show you this relative path in the video. </font>

### **Module 33 · 📚 Insert (UI/UX)**  
**Status:** ✅ Complete 
**Summary:**  The new detection feature caused issues (especially the text from IT, since there are lots of terms in English, it raises an error in `ZH` box) when translating code input, so automatic language detection is disabled by default.

**See details:** 👇 screenshot

### **Module 34 · 🏡 Home Admin (UI/UX)**
**Status:** ✅ Complete 
**Summary:**  Conflicts occur between '<span>' and rendering  when searching for 'A' related entries, which was fixed already.

---

### **Module 35 · 📝 Log + 🛠️ Path Fixer (Toolkit)**
**Status:** ✅ Complete 
**Summary:**  
All `.md`s are required to be modified everytime the path is migrated. This is a question of path decoupling. For that, I programmed a utility for automated alternations (such as from [alt].... to any HTML formatted text)

<font color="C00000">You'll see it in the following Module! So I quit doing any job here.</font>


---

### **Module 11 · 💫 API (<font color="Blue">BackEnd Migration</font>)**
**Status:** ✅ Complete 
**Summary:**  Add a **time-filtered deletion feature** for batch removal of erroneous imports, accurate to the second.

### **Module 12 · 📑 Home Admin**
**Status:** ✅ Complete 
**Summary:**  Enable **inline editing** of previewed matches (same as `Add Entry` being merged).  

**See details:** 👇 screenshot

---

### **Module 13 · 📑 Home Admin**
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Summary:**  
- Reinstate **source-based filtering** in search. The source field should allow both **selection and manual input**.
- Implement 🛠️ **Bulk Replace** for unified source modification.

---

### **Module 14 · 📚 Insert**
**Status:** ❌ Failed
**Summary:**  `.jpg` files (e.g., `smile.jpg`🙂) cannot be parsed because current regex logic splits on periods — adopt an ML-based or context-aware tokenization model. 
 <font color="C00000">(I am going to add some trained models for bilingual filtering, but that's possible when breaking away from a Streamlit container ❌)</font>

---

### **Module 15 · 📚 Insert**
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Summary:**  Add support for treating **a blank line as a paragraph break**.

---

### **Module 17 · 📚 Insert + 🏡 Home Admin**
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Summary:**   Enable **collective bilingual edits** by cloning sentence rows, allowing ID-based replacement (simulating in-place modification since SQL's PK are uniquely identified)

## **2 · System Constraints & Forward Plan**

### **Module 18 · 💼 Toolkit**
**Status:** 🚧 Designing
**Summary:**   Set up a new development toolkit for the translation software (similar to an integrated management system or website management platform that will hold fonts, template, website, and so on...)

---

### **Module 19 · 🌌 All Features**
**Status:** 🚧 Designing
**Summary:**   The database cannot be directly modified and displayed dynamically (equivalent to "no matter how you drag or move things around, the content will still show up," like the copy button beside the code block in Chat). This feature is currently not supported by Streamlit, so it's expected to move away from the Streamlit framework and switch to a more formal web mode (higher flexibility).

---

### **Module 20 · 🌌 All Features**
**Status:** 🚧 Designing
**Summary:**   How to input mathematical formulas? Ideally, there should be an equation editing module, and some of the trained models are available online; however, the feature is limited by current framework.

---

### **Module 21 · 🌌 All Features**
**Status:** 🚧 Designing
**Summary:**   How to input mathematical formulas? Ideally, there should be an equation editing module, and some of the trained models are available online; however, the feature is limited by current framework.

---

### **Module 22 · 🌌 All Features**
**Status:** 🚧 Designing
**Summary:**   Add language switching.

---

### **Module 23 · 🌌 All Features**
**Status:** 🚧 Designing
**Summary:**   Design a complete style/theme system and adjust formatting.

---

### **Module 24 · 🌌 All Features**
**Status:** 🚧 Designing
**Summary:**   Set shortcut keys for the software and design the UI for both desktop and web versions.

---

### **Module 25 · 🌌 All Features**
**Status:** 🚧 Designing
**Summary:**   Add animated transitions (currently unsupported in Streamlit).

---

### **Module 25 · 🔮 Index**
**Status:** 🚧 Designing
**Summary:**   Add an initial file index system, involving layout and data migration — this would be an entirely new feature!!!

---

## **3 · Implementation Notes**

- Most of the above enhancements can be implemented directly within existing `.py` modules using modular imports.  
- Some UI functions (floating bar, collapsible sidebar) will require **custom JavaScript injection or Streamlit component extensions**.  
- Batch renaming and inline editing logic should share a unified database trigger system to avoid duplication between `Home Admin` and `Insert`.
